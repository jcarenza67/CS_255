# DriverPass Project

* The DriverPass project involved designing a software system for a fictional client, DriverPass, which provides an online platform to manage student driver education. The client wanted a system that could handle student accounts, eligibility checks, administering tests with questions, and tracking progress records efficiently. The goal was to create a streamlined, user-friendly system that supports both students and administrators.

## What I Did Well

* I believe I did well in capturing the core entities and their relationships accurately in the system design document. The UML class diagram clearly models the domain with appropriate attributes and operations. Additionally, I was able to incorporate key system functionalities such as validation, progress updates, and eligibility checks into a well-defined controller class, which shows a good understanding of software design principles like separation of concerns.

## Area for Improvement

* If I were to revise one part of the work, I would focus on expanding the system design document to include more detailed behavioral diagrams, such as sequence or activity diagrams, to complement the class diagram. This would provide a better visualization of the interactions and workflows, making the design easier to understand and implement by developers.

## Interpreting User Needs and Their Importance

* I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing the requirements outlined by the client, then mapping those needs to system components that directly address them—like associating progress tracking with students and linking tests with questions. Considering user needs is critical because a system that does not align with real user workflows or priorities will not be effective, leading to poor adoption and costly revisions.

## Approach to Software Design

* My approach to software design starts with thoroughly understanding the problem domain and requirements. I use iterative modeling techniques—starting with high-level diagrams and progressively adding detail. In the future, I plan to integrate more user feedback loops and prototyping early on, combined with modular design strategies, to ensure the system is both functional and maintainable.
